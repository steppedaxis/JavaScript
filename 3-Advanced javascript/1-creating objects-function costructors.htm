/*
costructor prototype explaination:

1) Every JavaScript object has a prototype property,which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript.

2) The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want other objects to inherit.

3) The Constructor's prototype property is not the prototype of the Constructor itself, but it's the prototype of all instances that are created through it.

4) When a certain method, or property, is called, the search starts in the object itself, and if it cannot be found there, the search moves up on to the object's prototype.
This continues until the method is found, this is the prototype chain.

// normal way to write objects,as we have learned before
var john={
    name:'john',
    birth_year:1993,
    job:'teacher'
}




//that is how we write constructors(or classes)in javascript, its actually a function
// that hold the variabels we want the class to have.
//note: by standart, its is well known that class names will always be written with a capital letter
var Person=function(name,year_birth,job) {
  //we write this, so that javascript will know that the name it gets will refer to the object that is created as an instance of the Person class
    this.name=name //we write this, so that javascript will know that the name it gets will refer to the object that is created as an instance of the Person class
    this.year_birth=year_birth
    this.job=job

    //this is how a class method is created,always remember the 'this' keyword
    this.calcage=function () {
        console.log(2019-this.year_birth)
    }
}

Person.prototype.incomcalc=function() {
    console.log(700)
};

//the 'new' word means that a new empty instance is created and refers the given variables at the constructor to the instance itslef
//that is how we create an instance of the Person class,as john,1998 and teacher are values that are sent to the Person consturctor
var john=new Person('john',1998,'teacher')
var jane=new Person('jane',1995,'designer')
var mark=new Person('mark',1990,'retired')

console.log(john)


jane.incomcalc()

//the prototype chain is a chain that objects go threw when they are trying to call on a certin methods
// its importent to know,that every class in an instance of the 'object' object that has its own proprties, and after this there is nothing(null)
//this means that when a function trys to call a method, it will look for it in its own blueprint
//if it does not find it, it will go on to the next prototype, till it finds it, if it does not find it,it will return  null
